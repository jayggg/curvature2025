# Computing Curvature of Surfaces in NGSolve


Notebooks on extrinsic and intrinsic curvature computations in NGSolve
can be found here:


https://jayggg.github.io/curvature2025/


The notebooks here were prepared by Jay Gopalakrishnan for
presentation at the NGSolve User Meeting in Hamburg on June
12, 2025. They were prepared with significant input from Michael
Neunteufel and Joachim Sch√∂berl. Send all comments to gjay@pdx.edu.
